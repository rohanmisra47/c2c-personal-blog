# Getting Started with Coding: A Clinician's Journey

As a healthcare professional, the decision to learn coding might seem daunting at first. However, the skills we develop as clinicians - problem-solving, attention to detail, and systematic thinking - are actually perfect for programming.

## Why I Started Coding

After years of working in healthcare, I realized that many of our daily challenges could be solved more efficiently with technology. From streamlining patient documentation to creating tools for medical education, the possibilities seemed endless.

## First Steps

1. **Choose a Programming Language**: I started with Python because of its readability and extensive libraries for healthcare applications.
2. **Find Learning Resources**: FreeCodeCamp, Codecademy, and MDN Web Docs became my go-to resources.
3. **Practice Daily**: Even 30 minutes a day can make a significant difference.

## Challenges and Solutions

The biggest challenge was finding time between shifts. I started by:
- Using my lunch breaks to watch coding tutorials
- Practicing during night shifts when patient load was lower
- Joining online coding communities for support

## Next Steps

I'm excited to continue this journey and share my experiences with other healthcare professionals interested in coding. In future posts, I'll dive deeper into specific programming concepts and how they relate to healthcare.
